# Resume-Parsing-and-Analysis-App using Spacy and NER

This project aims to automate the extraction of key information from resumes and match candidate resumes with job descriptions based on the extracted information.

This project speaks about a field in Natural language Processing and Information Retrieval called Named Entity Recognition and how we can apply it for automatically generating summaries of resumes by extracting only chief entities like name, education background, skills, etc.
It is often observed that resumes may be populated with excess information, often irrelevant to what the evaluator is looking for in it. Therefore, the process of evaluation of resumes in bulk often becomes tedious and hectic. Through our NER model, we could facilitate evaluation of resumes at a quick glance, thereby simplifying the effort required in shortlisting candidates among a pile of resumes.

## What is Named Entity Recognition?

Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction) is a sub-task of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.
